Alex,

Here’s the raw data I collected for Irrigation Journal from 1997 – 2000 (Charlie Privette did it before then until he retired).  Just FYI – the data was gathered each year by county agents for their own county;  Some used a combination of calling large farmers and FSA data, others contacted farmers.  Separated by irrigation method, and in another table below the first by crop irrigated.  There should be a State Total column as the last column for each of these.  Summary of State totals by year:

                1996 – 160870 (Charlie Privette’s numbers; I don’t have individual info on this year)
                1997 – 135329 (Survey97d.XLS)
                1998 – 134942 (Survey98d.xls)
                1999 – 146061 (Survey99d.xls)
                2000 – 161069 (Survey00d.xls)

Just FYI – I don’t claim these are more or less accurate than the ones you have, but most of the agents did a pretty good job on this.  I know you can compare these with weather data to see how rainfall may have played a part.

One thought from today – the upstate above the fall line will be limited in irrigation growth due to lack of accessible high volume aquifers.  We have a hard time accessing decent volumes of water to irrigate with via wells.  Surface water access, if available, will probably be the main growth option.

From an email 5/15/2023:
I did not know the Irrigation Journal magazine was no more – or maybe renamed or absorbed since 2000.  Here’s the contact info I had from 2001, at least:

                Irrigation Journal
Adams Business Media
250 South Wacker Drive, Suite 1150
Chicago. Illinois  60606
Phone 312-980-3754
Fax 312-980-3126

The magazine was published by Adams Publishing.

As far as the acreage goes, our data to the Irrigation Journal was collected by individual Extension Agents, most of whom either sat down with the growers or knew their irrigated acreage from dealing with them.  I am not sure how the Census collects their data, but I would expect that ours was a bit more accurate due to the personal interaction with growers and the fact that we asked questions and wrote things down.  I had one agent pulling info from the USDA-FSA (then USDA-ASCS) reports, but the rest worked with the growers directly.

Phone Conversation with Mr. Smith, 5/15/2023

Farms go out of business
Can’t irrigate pasture and make money
Infrastructure aging and not being replaced.
Farmers hate the census
The 210k figure might not capture all of the small guys. Small guys not participating in FSA programs.
Reporting in these other datasets may have improved over time (probably did). Web forms, and younger farmers.

Very wet years. 1997 and 1998 were pretty wet, 2000 was pretty dry.

Charlie Privett was keeping up with it until he retired in the 1990’s (now passed). Prior to 1997. 
Maybe in back issues of the irrigation journal.

2 inches isn’t enough for corn / week. Inch and a quarter for cotton, inch for soy

It was a massive undertaking, and got lots of fussing and cussing from folks against it. Irrigation Journal was doing it nationwide, so we wanted to keep up. It would be a difficult endeavor to do it now. A smaller portion of farmers rely on Clemson Extension nowadays.
