*cuscirrigationsurvey* is an *R* package that contains survey data
compiled from South Carolina County Extension Agents of Clemson
University annually from 1997-2000. Some of this data was published
previously in Irrigation Journal (2001), but *cuscirrigationsurvey* is
likely the most thorough compilation of that work available today. The
package author received the data from W. Bryan Smith, Area Extension
Agent and director of the irrigation survey efforts from 1998-2000. The
survey was conducted prior to 1997, however that data has not been found
or made available to the package author.

The data was gathered each year by county agents for their own county,
most of whom either sat down with the growers or knew their irrigated
acreage from dealing with them.

This dataset provides a unique perspective on irrigation in South
Carolina, that is still relevant today. This survey effort was the most
comprehensive ever before conducted, and there were no other comparable
data collection efforts for years afterwards. Lacking comprehensive
data, later reports regarding irrigation in SC estimated general
declines from 2000 to 2010. More recently (~2015 - ~2020), reported
irrigation in South Carolina has increased substantially.
Hypothetically, some of the recent increase can be attributed to
under-estimated values after the year 2000.

To acccess the dataset, you can install the package using R:

``` r
# install.package('devtools') ## install devtools if you don't have it already.
devtools::install_github("capellett/cuscirrigationsurvey")
```
