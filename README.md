*cuscirrigationsurvey* is an *R* package that contains survey data
compiled from South Carolina County Extension Agents of Clemson
University annually from 1997-2000. Some of this data was published
previously in Irrigation Journal (2001), but *cuscirrigationsurvey* is
likely the most thorough compilation of that work available today. The
package author received the data from W. Bryan Smith, Area Extension
Agent and director of the irrigation survey efforts from 1998-2000. The
survey was conducted prior to 1997, however that data has not been found
or made available to the package author.

The data was gathered each year by county agents for their own county;
Some used a combination of calling large farmers and FSA data, others
contacted farmers.
